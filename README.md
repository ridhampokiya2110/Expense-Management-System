## 🌟 Key Features Explained

### OCR Receipt Scanning
The OCR feature uses Tesseract.js to extract data from receipt images:
1. Upload receipt image (JPG, PNG, etc.)
2. System processes image and extracts:
   - Amount and currency
   - Date of expense
   - Merchant/vendor name
   - Individual line items
   - Expense category (auto-categorized)
3. Review and edit extracted data
4. Submit with confidence

### Currency Conversion
Real-time currency conversion ensures accurate reporting:
1. Employee submits in any currency (e.g., EUR)
2. System fetches current exchange rate
3. Converts to company currency (e.g., USD)
4. Displays both amounts for transparency
5. Managers see converted amount for approval

### Notification System
Stay informed with real-time notifications:
- New expense submitted (for approvers)
- Expense approved (for employees)
- Expense rejected with reason (for employees)
- Approval request moved to next step
- Bell icon shows unread count
- Click to view expense details
